# Bookdown cheat sheet

Here's where I park _little_ *examples* **for myself** about bookdown mechanics that I keep forgetting.

## Heading blah blah

## About labelling things {#id-example}

You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Section \@ref(id-example). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., this reference to the unlabelled heading \@ref(heading-blah-blah) uses the automatically generated label `\@ref(heading-blah-blah)`.

## Cross-references

Add an explicit label by adding `{#label}` to the end of the section header. If you know you're going to refer to something, this is probably a good idea.

To refer to in a chapter- or section-number-y way, use `\@ref(label)`.

  * `\@ref(install-git)` example: In chapter \@ref(install-git) we explain how to install Git.

If you are happy with the section header as the link text, use it inside a single set of square brackets:

  * `[A picture is worth a thousand words]`: example "A picture is worth a thousand words" via [A picture is worth a thousand words]

There are two ways to specify custom link text:

  * `[link text][Section header text]`, e.g., "pic = 1000 words" via [pic = 1000 words][A picture is worth a thousand words]
  * `[link text](#label)`, e.g., "RStudio, meet Git" via [RStudio, meet Git](#rstudio-see-git)
  
The Pandoc documentation provides more details on automatic section IDs and implicit header references.

## Figures, tables, citations

Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively.

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@knitr-book].

## How the square bracket links work

Context: you prefer to link with text, not a chapter or section number.

  * GOOD! Here's a link to [Contributors].
  * BAD. You can see contributors in \@ref(contrib).

Facts and vocabulary

  * Each chapter is a file. These files should begin with the chapter title using a level-one header, e.g., `# Chapter Title`.
  * A chapter can be made up of sections, indicated by lower-level headers, e.g., `## A section within the chapter`.
  * There are three ways to address a section when creating links within your book:
    - **Explicit identifier**: In `# My header {#foo}` the explicit identifier is `foo`.
    - **Automatically generated identifier**: `my-header` is the auto-identifier for `# My header`. Pandoc creates auto-identifiers according to rules laid out in [Extension: auto_identifiers](http://pandoc.org/README.html#extension-auto_identifiers).
    - The header text, e.g., `My header` be used verbatim as an **implicit header reference**. See [Extension: implicit_header_references](http://pandoc.org/README.html#extension-implicit_header_references) for more.
  * All 3 forms can be used to create cross-references but you build the links differently.
  * Advantage of explicit identification: You are less likely to update the section header and then forget to make matching edits to references elsewhere in the book.

How to make text-based links using explicit identifiers, automatic identifiers, and implicit references:

  * Use implicit reference alone to get a link where the text is exactly the section header:
    - `[Introduce yourself to Git]` [Introduce yourself to Git]
    - `[Success and operating systems]` [Success and operating systems]
  * You can provide custom text for the link with all 3 methods of addressing a section:
    - Implicit header reference: `[link text][Recommended Git clients]` [link text][Recommended Git clients]    
    - Explicit identifier: `[hello git! I'm Jenny](#hello-git)` [hello git! I'm Jenny](#hello-git)
    - Automatic identifier: `[Any text you want](#recommended-git-clients)` [Any text you want](#recommended-git-clients)
