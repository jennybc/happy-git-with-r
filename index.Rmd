# What's going on here {-}

THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT!

Trying this, gradually: bring (and expand) the STAT 545 content into bookdown format, in anticipation of the tutorial at useR! 2016:

  * [session](http://schedule.user2016.org/event/7Bad/using-git-and-github-with-r-rstudio-and-r-markdown-part-1) in the useR! schedule
  * [full description](http://user2016.org/tutorials/01.html) on the main site
  * [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/happy-git-and-github-for-the-user) for a related talk I've given a couple times
  * [landing page](http://stat545.com/git00_index.html) for all most of the related stuff at [stat545.com](http://stat545.com/index.html)
  
```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
