# Workshops

These materials can be used for independent study, but I also use them to support

  * in-person workshops (see below)
  * [STAT 545](http://stat545.com) at UBC
  * [UBC Master of Data Science](http://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca)

## Pre-workshop set-up

Optional reading on the big picture motivation: [Why Git? Why GitHub?](#big-picture)

**It is vital that you attempt to set up your system in advance. You cannot show up at the workshop with no preparation and keep up!**

These are battle-tested instructions, so most will succeed. We believe in you! If you have trouble, reach out for help and stick with it. If we have not pointed you to a specific forum dedicated to your workshop (check below), you can open an issue [here](https://github.com/jennybc/happy-git-with-r/issues) and we *might* be able to help in the days leading up to your workshop (no promises).

Try this. Best case scenario is about 1 - 2 hours. If you hit a wall, we will help:

  * [Register a free GitHub account](#github-acct).
  * [Install or update R and RStudio](#install-r-rstudio).
  * [Install Git](#install-git).
  * [Introduce yourself to Git](#hello-git).
  * [Prove local Git can talk to GitHub](#push-pull-github).
  * [Cache your username and password](#credential-caching) or [set up SSH keys](#ssh-keys) so you don't need to authenticate yourself to GitHub interactively *ad nauseum*.
  * [Prove RStudio can find local Git](#rstudio-git-github) and, therefore, can talk to GitHub.
    - FYI: this is where our hands-on activities usually start. We walk through a similar activity together, with narrative, and build from there.

Troubleshooting:

  * Sometimes RStudio [needs a little help finding Git](#rstudio-see-git).
  * General troubleshooting: [RStudio, Git, GitHub Hell](#troubleshooting).

## rstudio::conf 2018

**[rstudio::conf 2018 What They Forgot to Teach You About R](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/#training2)** Workshop content is ~25% Git/GitHub + R/Rmd/Rstudio. Registered workshop participants should use [this thread](https://community.rstudio.com/t/what-they-forgot-to-teach-you-system-setup/4339?u=jennybryan) on community.rstudio.com to discuss system prep woes. We will also have helpers on site to help sort out issues, especially during morning break and lunch on day 1. First use of Git is after lunch on day 1. Get as far as you can! Every bit helps.
