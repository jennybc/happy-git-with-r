Happy Git provides opinionated instructions on how to:

  * Install Git and get it working smoothly with GitHub, in the shell and through the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/).
  * Integrate Git and GitHub into your daily work with R and [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).
  * Develop a few key workflows that cover your most common tasks.
  
The target reader is someone who uses R for data analysis or who works on R packages, but some of the content may be useful to those working in adjacent areas.
