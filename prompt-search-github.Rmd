## Use case

What if a function in a package has no examples? Or is poorly exampled? Wouldn't it be nice to find functioning instances of it "in the wild"?

[Via Twitter](https://twitter.com/noamross/status/563422536633839617), Noam Ross taught me a clever way to do such searches on GitHub. Put this into the GitHub search box to see how packages on CRAN use the `llply()` function from `plyr`:

``` bash
"llply" user:cran language:R
```

Or just [click here](https://github.com/search?l=r&q=%22llply%22+user%3Acran+language%3AR&ref=searchresults&type=Code).

Another example that recently came up on r-package-devel:

How to see lots of examples of roxygen templates?

This search finds >1400 examples of roxygen templates in the wild:
