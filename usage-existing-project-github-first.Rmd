# Existing project, GitHub first {#existing-github-first}

A novice-friendly workflow for bringing an existing R project into the RStudio and Git/GitHub universe.

We do this in a slightly awkward way, in order to avoid using Git at the command line. You won't want to work this way forever, but it's perfectly fine as you're getting started!

We assume you've got your existing R project isolated in a directory on your computer. If that's not already true, make it so. Create a directory and marshal all the existing data and R scripts there. It doesn't really matter where you do this, but note where the project currently lives.

## Make a repo on GitHub

Go to <https://github.com> and make sure you are logged in.

Click the green "New repository" button. Or, if you are on your own profile page, click on "Repositories", then click the green "New" button.

Pick a repository name that actually reminds you what the project is about! But try to be concise.

Public  
YES Initialize this repository with a README

Click the big green button "Create repository."

Copy the HTTPS clone URL to your clipboard via the green "Clone or Download" button. Or copy the SSH URL if you chose to set up SSH keys.

## New RStudio Project via git clone

In RStudio, start a new Project:

  * *File > New Project > Version Control > Git*. In the "repository URL" paste the URL of your new GitHub repository. It will be something like this `https://github.com/jennybc/myrepo.git`.
  * Be intentional about where you create this Project.
  * Suggest you "Open in new session".
  * Click "Create Project" to create a new directory, which will be all of these things:
    - a directory or "folder" on your computer
    - a Git repository, linked to a remote GitHub repository
    - an RStudio Project

This should download the `README.md` file that we created on GitHub in the previous step. Look in RStudio's file browser pane for the `README.md` file.

## Bring your existing project over

Using your favorite method of moving or copying files, copy the files that constitute your existing project into the directory for this new project.

In RStudio, consult the Git pane and the file browser.

  * Are you seeing all the files? They should be here if your move/copy was successful.
  * Are they showing up in the Git pane with questions marks? They should be appearing as new untracked files.
  
## Stage and commit

Commit your files to this repo. How?

  * Click the "Git" tab in upper right pane
  * Check "Staged" box for all files you want to commit.
    - Default: stage it.
    - When to reconsider: this will all go to GitHub. So do consider if that is appropriate for each file. **You can absolutely keep a file locally, without committing it to the Git repo and sending to GitHub**. Just let it sit there in your Git pane, without being staged. No harm will be done. If this is a long-term situation, list the file in `.gitignore`.
  * If you're not already in the Git pop-up, click "Commit"
  * Type a message in "Commit message", such as "init".
  * Click "Commit"

## Push your local changes to GitHub

Click the green "Push" button to send your local changes to GitHub. You should see some message along these lines.

``` bash
[master dc671f0] blah
 3 files changed, 22 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 .gitignore
 create mode 100644 myrepo.Rproj
```

## Confirm the local change propagated to the GitHub remote

Go back to the browser. I assume we're still viewing your new GitHub repo.

Refresh.

You should see all the project files you committed there.

If you click on "commits," you should see one with the message "init".

## The end

Now just ... repeat. Do work somewhere. Commit it. Push it or pull it\* depending on where you did it, but get local and remote "synced up". Repeat.

\* Note that in general (and especially in future when collaborating with other developers) you will usually need to pull changes from the remote (GitHub) before pushing the local changes you have made. For this reason, it's a good idea to try and get into the habit of pulling before you attempt to push.
