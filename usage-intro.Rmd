# (PART) Early GitHub Wins {-} 

# Get started with GitHub {#usage-intro .unnumbered}

Now that we've verified your Git/GitHub/RStudio setup, we can demo the workflows you'll use to get your work onto GitHub:

  * [New project, GitHub first] is the easiest way to get a working project.
  * [Existing project, GitHub first] is a deeply pragmatic way to get pre-existing work onto GitHub.
  * [Existing project, GitHub last] is the more proper way to connect existing local work to a remote on GitHub, especially if there's already a Git history.
  
This part concludes with two R-specific workflows that show off how well [R Markdown (the format)](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) and [rmarkdown (the package)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmarkdown) work with GitHub:

  * [Test drive R Markdown]
  * [Render an R script]
