Here’s some prose in a very special comment. Let’s summarize the
built-in dataset `VADeaths`.

``` r
## here is a regular code comment, that will remain as such
summary(VADeaths)
```

    ##    Rural Male     Rural Female     Urban Male     Urban Female  
    ##  Min.   :11.70   Min.   : 8.70   Min.   :15.40   Min.   : 8.40  
    ##  1st Qu.:18.10   1st Qu.:11.70   1st Qu.:24.30   1st Qu.:13.60  
    ##  Median :26.90   Median :20.30   Median :37.00   Median :19.30  
    ##  Mean   :32.74   Mean   :25.18   Mean   :40.48   Mean   :25.28  
    ##  3rd Qu.:41.00   3rd Qu.:30.90   3rd Qu.:54.60   3rd Qu.:35.10  
    ##  Max.   :66.00   Max.   :54.30   Max.   :71.10   Max.   :50.00

Here’s some more prose. I can use usual markdown syntax to make things
**bold** or *italics*. Let’s use an example from the `dotchart()` help
to make a Cleveland dot plot from the `VADeaths` data. I even bother to
name this chunk, so the resulting PNG has a decent name.

``` r
dotchart(VADeaths, main = "Death Rates in Virginia - 1940")
```
