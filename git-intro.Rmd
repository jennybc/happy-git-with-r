# (PART) Git fundamentals {-} 

# Some Git basics {#git-intro .unnumbered}

We've told you shockingly little about Git so far! This is by design.

We find that actual usage, in the course of your work, is the most effective way to build up a useful mental model for Git. In live workshops, we strive to introduce the most important basic ideas in the context of our guided activities. Self-learners can achieve the same by working through the "batteries included" guides earlier in the previous sections.

However, building on this early success, now is the perfect time to explicitly define some Git vocabulary. We also want to help you link Git concepts to data science tasks and projects.

This part collects anything we've written about core Git concepts. It is a work in progress and is conceived as a complement to the many excellent [external resources for Git](#resources), which we have no desire to re-invent.
