# Workshops

These materials can be used for independent study, but I also use them to support

  * in-person workshops (see below)
  * [STAT 545](http://stat545.com) at UBC
  * [UBC Master of Data Science](http://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca)

## Pre-workshop set-up

Optional reading on the big picture motivation: [Why Git? Why GitHub?](#big-picture)

**It is vital that you attempt to set up your system in advance. You cannot show up at the workshop with no preparation and keep up!**

These are battle-tested instructions, so most will succeed. We believe in you! If you have trouble, you can open an issue [here](https://github.com/jennybc/happy-git-with-r/issues) and we *might* be able to help in the days leading up to your workshop (no promises).

*For satRday Cape Town, we will have a few helpers in the tutorial to help sort out issues. Get as far as you can. Every bit helps.*

Try this. Give it about 1 - 2 hours. If you hit a wall, we will help:

  * [Register a free GitHub account](#github-acct).
  * [Install or update R and RStudio](#install-r-rstudio).
  * [Install Git](#install-git).
  * [Introduce yourself to Git](#hello-git).
  * [Prove local Git can talk to GitHub](#push-pull-github).
  * [Cache your username and password](#credential-caching) or [set up SSH keys](#ssh-keys) so you don't need to authenticate yourself to GitHub interactively *ad nauseum*.
  * [Prove RStudio can find local Git](#rstudio-git-github) and, therefore, can talk to GitHub.
    - FYI: this is where our hands-on activities usually start. We walk through a similar activity together, with narrative, and build from there.

Troubleshooting:

  * Sometimes RStudio [needs a little help finding Git](#rstudio-see-git).
  * General troubleshooting: [RStudio, Git, GitHub Hell](#troubleshooting).
