We practice what we preach! This site is created with Git and R markdown, using the [`bookdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/) package. Go ahead and [peek behind the scenes](https://github.com/jennybc/happy-git-with-r).

Long-term, you should understand more about what you are doing. Rote clicking in RStudio may be a short-term survival method but won't work for long.

  * [trygit](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) is to (command line) Git as [swirl](http://swirlstats.com) is to R. Learn by doing, in small bites.

  * The book [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book) is fantastic and comprehensive.
  
  * [Git in Practice](https://www.manning.com/books/git-in-practice) by Mike McQuaid is an more approachable book, probably better than Pro Git for most people starting out. Ancillary materials [on GitHub](https://github.com/GitInPractice).

  * [GitHub's own training materials](http://training.github.com/kit/) may be helpful. They also point to [many other resources](https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-other-good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github)

  * Find a powerful Git client (chapter \@ref(git-client)) if you'd like to minimize your usage of Git from the command line.
  
  * Hadley Wickham's book [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz) has an excellent [chapter on the use of Git, GitHub, and RStudio](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html) in R package development. He covers more advanced usage, such as commit best practices, issues, branching, and pull requests.
  
  * Ten Simple Rules for Taking Advantage of Git and GitHub <http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947>

  * RStudio's guide [Version Control with Git and SVN](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN)
