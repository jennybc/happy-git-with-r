It's not you, it's Git!

If you're not crying already, these fictional-but-realistic Git man pages should do the trick:

  * [git-man-page-generator](http://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net)
  * And, of course, the underlying source is also available on GitHub:
    - <https://github.com/Lokaltog/git-man-page-generator>

If you can tolerate adult and often offensive language, you might enjoy:

  * <http://www.commitlogsfromlastnight.com>
  * <http://ohshitgit.com/>

Your commits will look more glorious scrolling by Star Wars style:

  * <http://starlogs.net>
  * <http://starlogs.net/#jennybc/googlesheets>
  * Do this for any repo: `http://starlogs.net/#USER/REPO`
